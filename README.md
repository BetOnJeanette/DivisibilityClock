# Divisibility Clock
This webapp automatically creates divisibility clocks like the ones shown in [Numberphile's "Solving Seven" video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ki-M1DJIZsk). It takes in a number, and creates a directional graph (the clock) for dividing rules.

# Dev
This repo is built using Bun and Astro. To get started, install bun and run `bun install`. Once it is installed, you can run `bun dev` to have the server set up.
